Contra was created by me, photofroggy. I personally think some credit
is appropriate as there are people who have been a great help in the
creation of Contra. These are those people, in no particular order.

- Electricnet
	"Elec" has helped by testing Contra on Apple computers, and
	providing valuable feedback on Contra, and at one point he had
	to remind me that Contra was meant to be user friendly. It should
	also be noted that the original structure of Contra's dAmn
	processing was based on his PHP bot, which was used as a reference.
	Thanks for all the fish!
	
- Hakumiogin
	This guy provided inspiration for the events system currently being
	used in Contra's module system. It is awesome and quite flexible. It
	should be noted, however, that the event system being developed in
	dbpc is looking to be incredibly flexible.
	
- ManjyomeThunder
	"Manjy" Has provides inspiration for ideas, directly and indirectly. He
	is my arch nemesis. He constantly makes good progress with his bots,
	supposedly competing against me, and he does a bloody good job of it!
	If it weren't for him it is likely that I might be going about things
	in an even more lazy manner.
	
- Infinity0
	Infinity0 is mainly insulting. If I ever talk to him, he is likely to
	throw an insult in my direction. These insults sometimes have something
	constructive attached to them, which is helpful. He also helped me move
	over to streams from using sockets, and provided working shell scripts
	for *nix systems. Like Elec, he has also kepted me in check, he prodded
	me about code repetition, something which should always be avoided at all
	costs! Again, thanks for the help.
	
- Plaguethenet
	Plaguethenet is one of those strange people who turns up at random moments
	and then hibernates for any given length of time. When he is active, however,
	he provides very useful advice and ideas. His work with languages using the
	.NET framework is also an inspiration of sorts, as I wouldn't usually touch
	them myself.
	
- #Botdom
	This is for all the users of #Botdom. Without #Botdom I would never have
	gotten into bot development, I doubt I would even know PHP if it werent't
	for this place. #Botdom really is awesome!
	
If you ever get the chance, go give these people some love!
