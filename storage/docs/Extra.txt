-- TRIVIA --
Just some stuff that might be vaguely interesting.

	* Work was started on Contra on 15th July 2008
	after I finally decided that Amphino was a messy,
	inefficient piece of rubbish.
	
	* The console output actually has colours, even
	for Windows users! If you have Windows, download
	Cygwin and use that to run your .cmd files.
	
	* More time has been spent on getting .command files
	to work as expected on OS X than on any other feature
	in Contra.
	
	Ok that was a lie, but lots of time has been spent on
	it, and it's taken three developers to get it simplified
	enough to be awesome.
	
	* Contra actually shares some code with Amphino. Most
	of this shared code can be found in function_lib.php
	in the core folder.
	
	* Concerning dAmn events: I don't know what arguments
	are given to my events system, by my dAmn processing
	stuff, for most dAmn events. It does, however, work
	without problems. Just don't ask me if you need to know
	what the arguments are for a certain event.
	
	* Contra is friendly to developers too! The module
	system featured in Contra is also designed to be
	easy to use (in programming terms)!
	
	* I love feedback! No, really. Give me feedback on Contra,
	I'd love to know what you have to say about it. Head over
	to the discussion page of Contra's artical on the Botdom
	wiki to give feedback!
	
	* Contra had a stable preview release within a week. The
	next week, the first public release was... released. I'd
	call that quick if you asked me.
	
	Quick compared to Futurism anyway...
